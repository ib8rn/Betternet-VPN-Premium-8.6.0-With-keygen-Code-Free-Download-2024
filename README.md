Betternet is a simple to use VPN service provider application which is capable of changing your IP address and allow you to navigate the Internet with no restrictions. The application enables you to connect to a VPN server and enjoy protection from IP trackers, while browsing the Internet.
Betternet allows you to connect to a specific VPN server and provides you with unrestricted access to websites that are otherwise blocked in your location. For example, you can access pages that are blocked for security reasons in schools or public institutions.
The application can help you overpass blocked websites or pages, due to political agreements for your current location. You can view any video on YouTube or unblock social network websites, as well as circumvent VOIP protocol limitations.
Moreover, as the application can change your IP address, you can navigate the Internet without concerns about ISP or other trackers. You can thus avoid ads, activity tracing or spam attacks.
Betternet is particularly useful when connecting to public, unsecured WI-FI hotspots, since it can protect your data. Betternet can encrypt your username, password and other private information that are otherwise made public for anyone to view.
Betternet can work with any Internet browser that supports proxy servers, including Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox. It is a simple application, with a minimalistic interface, which allows you to quickly connect or disconnect from the server. As soon as you are connected, the Betternet service webpage opens in the default browser, indicating your new IP address.
Betternet offers you a reliable security solution for navigating the Internet. The application can change your IP, encrypt your data and protect you from activity trackers. It allows you to browse the Web anonymously, as well as access blocked websites due to the geographical location or other policies.
